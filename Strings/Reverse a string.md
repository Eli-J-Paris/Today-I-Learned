## Reverse a string with Array.Reverse() 
To reverse a string you first will need to turn the string into a char array. The string class doesn't have a method to reverse a string but the Array class has a static `Reverse()`Â method to flip the order of the elements in the array.

 *This is just one way of reversing a string*
 
 The important thing to remeber here is you when reversing the array the array you want to reverse needs to be inside the method invocation operator `()` so calling `arryFirstName.Reverse()` wont reverse the array.
